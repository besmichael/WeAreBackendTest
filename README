To run the Django Server do the following:
1. Install Python 3.6.0
2. Activate the Virtual env I used (source virtenv/bin/activate). Normally I would have made an egg with a python file that listed dependencies.
3. Step into the Project directory and run tests (python manage.py test)
4. Provided tests pass, run project (python manage.py runserver)
Hit the api with your prefered web browswer or command line tool at localhost (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/weather/summary/munich/20190515/0100/)


Note: the project did not specify that any cities outside of Berlin might be pinged, but any german city works in the URL. For this reason I refrained from handling bad city inputs.
