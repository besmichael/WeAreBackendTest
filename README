To run the Django Server do the following:
1. Install Python 3.6.0
2. Activate the Virtual env I used (source virtenv/bin/activate). Normally I would have made an egg with a python file that listed dependencies.
3. Step into the Project directory and run tests (python manage.py test)
4. Provided tests pass, run project (python manage.py runserver)
